#Create a simple program. Imagine you are writing software for a coffee shop that calculates the price of a coffee order. The price depends on the size of the coffee and whether the customer wants any extras.
#Create variables for size (small, medium, large) and has_extra (True or False).
#Use if, elif, and else statements to calculate the total price based on the following rules:
#Small coffee: $2.00
#Medium coffee: $3.00
#Large coffee: $4.00
#Extra (regardless of size): Additional $1.00
#Print the total price.

#solution
#welcome the customer
print("Hi,welcome to Gokendro Coffee Store")

#get customer's name
customers_name = input("What is your name: ")
print(f"Welcome, {customers_name}")

#Display available coffee sizes
print("We sell small, medium and large sizes of coffee")

#Get the desired coffee size
