#Randomisation and python lists
#if we want our prog to do different thgs each time, we use randomisationThey are majorly used in games because we want the outcome to be unpredictable
#for us to tap into the random module in python, we have to import it first

import random 
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_integer)

#random module in a python module. for a very long code, we can split the module into different functionality, each module doing a different things.
